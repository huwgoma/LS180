#1 
  -- psql 
  \i films1.sql

  1. The films1.sql file deletes the films table if it exists, then creates a new
     table, films, with the columns title, year and genre; it then creates 3 new
     entries into the films table.

  2. The output of the command is as follows:
      psql:films1.sql:1: NOTICE:  table "films" does not exist, skipping
      DROP TABLE
      CREATE TABLE
      INSERT 0 1
      INSERT 0 1
      INSERT 0 1
    Each line in the output corresponds to an action described above; dropping the
    films table, creating a new films table, then inserting 3 new rows into the
    films table.

  3. The first line in films1.sql deletes the films table, if one already exists,
     to prevent namespace clashing.
