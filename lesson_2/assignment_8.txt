#3: List the 10 states with the most rows in the people table in descending order.
  - 10 states: LIMIT 10
  - Most rows: Order by count(id), descending
  - Group by state

  SELECT state, count(id) FROM people
  GROUP BY state
  ORDER BY count(id) DESC LIMIT 10;

#4: List each domain used in an email address, and how many people in the database
    have an email containing that domain.
    - descending order of domain popularity (ie. most-used first)

    example: 
    domain      count
    gmail.com     200
    hotmail.com   150
    yahoo.com     100

    -- Algorithm:
    - Extract the domain from email addresses
      - split email string on delimiter (@) and take the 2nd fragment
    - select the extracted domain and row count for each domain (group by domain)
    - order in descending order by domain row count

    SELECT split_part(email, '@', 2) AS domain, count(id) AS usage
    FROM people
    GROUP BY domain
    ORDER BY usage DESC;

#5:
  DELETE FROM people 
  WHERE id = 3399;

#6:
  DELETE FROM people 
  WHERE state = 'CA';

#7:
  UPDATE people
  SET given_name = upper(given_name)
  WHERE email LIKE '%teleworm.us%';

#8: 
  DELETE FROM people;
